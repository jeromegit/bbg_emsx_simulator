I want to create an application called bbg_emsx_simulator that simulates a FIX server and more specifically it should follow The Bloomberg IOI Network Indications of Interest & Trade Advertisement Fix Specification
It should use python and poetry
Use Python 3.11 or higher

For the FIX protocol communication it should reply on the quickfix libraries
Use the FIX version 4.2

The server will mantain some fake OMS orders in a csv file called oms_orders.csv. The columns of the file will be as follows: order_id, uuid, symbol, side, shares, price
The server will also have a streamlit component that shows the content of the oms_orders.csv as an editbale grid to an admin person and that admin person will be able to edit the content of the grid and save it
Suggest 5 rows for that csv file to start with and insert them into the file. shares should be > 10000. The order_id is unique and can be used as an index.
It should use a version of streamlit that supports editable tables

I also want to create a client to test the server.
That client will connect using a FIX session and promptly send a 35=6 FIX message with 50=1234 where 1234 is the UUID of the loging user
The server will respond by sending the orders currently in the oms_orders.csv file for which the uuid column = 1234. Each order should generate a 35=D message back to the client where the columns of the order should be sent as normal symbol in tag 55, side in tag 54 with 1=buy and 2=sell, shares in tag38, etc... tag50 should be the UUID
When the client sends a reserve request with 35=D, when the qty sent is odd, reject the reserve request, if the qty is even accept the request and send back a 35=D message with reserved shares.
